# Maintainer checklist

Everything the repository owner has to configure by hand. Nothing in this repository changes
repository settings, branch protection, Environments, secrets, Pages or Cloudflare; each item below
is a step for a person with admin rights. Items are grouped by the pull request that needs them.

## Repository

- [ ] Branch protection on `main`: require a pull request, require review from code owners, require
      the `test` check (and, once the validation workflow is merged, `validate`), require signed
      commits, block force pushes and deletion.
- [ ] Keep merging local and signed: GitHub's merge button and `gh pr merge` rewrite commits on the
      server and drop their signatures. Merge with `git merge --no-ff -S`, push, and delete the branch.
- [ ] Private vulnerability reporting (Settings, Code security) so that [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md)
      works as written.
- [ ] Two-factor authentication with a hardware-backed second factor for every owner and maintainer.

## Code owners

`.github/CODEOWNERS` names `@fogrew`, the repository owner. It can become a team: replace the owner
on the `/servers/` line with a reviewer team to let more people approve listings while signing-related
paths (`/.github/`, `/tools/`, `/config/`, `/keys/`, `/data/`, `/schema/`) stay with the owners. A
team must have write access to the repository for its code-owner review to count.
